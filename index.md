# Will Riddle's Portfolio 

I am a computer scientist at CSUF and I am looking to graduate by the year 2027

* Lab 12, part 2

   I really liked this lab because it involved us making images with code. We created different color images with the colors red, blue, and green. It was interesting trying to assign the image to a .gif file.

* Lab 3, part 1

  I liked this lab because you had to figure out what the customer ordered and assign it a unit price. We added a user input feature where we input an order into the terminal and it spits out the unit price per square inch. This is really useful for restaurants because it calculates the specific price of the different sizes of pizza.

* Lab 9, part 1

   This lab involved a series of scores given by judges to calculate the total score of the contestant. If there were not enough scores inputted into the system it would read an “invalid” message and tell you to provide more arguments. The use of loops for loops really helped us in this lab.
